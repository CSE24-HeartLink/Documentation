\section{Introduction}
    \subsection{Motivation}
    Just Speak, and Stay Connected

    Communication remains essential to all relationships. However, as our lives grow increasingly busy, maintaining natural and effortless connections becomes ever more challenging. While we commonly share our daily lives through texts and photos, these methods can sometimes lose their authenticity. Now, there is a need for a new mode of connection—one that allows us to capture and share moments through voice.

    With advancements in voice recognition and AI technology, this vision has become achievable. Particularly in family communication, a system that records daily moments through voice and automatically generates a feed for sharing can profoundly enhance connections. By converting voice-recorded moments into text and images, and automatically delivering these to family members, this system allows for more seamless and genuine communication between parents and children, as well as across generations.

    For instance, parents can stay updated on their children's daily lives without needing direct contact, while children can remain connected with family members through shared voice and visual updates. This voice-based interface not only bridges the digital divide between generations but also fosters a more natural and continuous flow of family communication.

    \subsection{Problem Statements}
        \subsubsection{Difficulty in Naturally Sharing Daily Life}
        Current social media platforms primarily rely on text input and photo uploads, making it challenging for users to capture and share their daily lives naturally. In situations where hands are occupied or real-time sharing is desired, users often have to interrupt or modify their experiences to create content that fits platform requirements. This compromises the authenticity of moments shared and makes it difficult to convey emotional depth in these interactions.
        
        \subsubsection{Generational Gaps in Digital Accessibility}
        Existing social media interfaces do not adequately address the accessibility differences that arise from variations in age and digital proficiency, which poses limitations for intergenerational family communication. Elderly users often find complex text input methods and intricate menu structures challenging, while younger children may struggle to express themselves naturally within traditional interfaces. These generational gaps hinder regular family communication, creating the risk that the perspectives and experiences of certain family members may be excluded from the family's shared narrative.
        
        \subsubsection{Limitations of Personalized Communication}

 Existing social media platforms (e.g., Instagram, Facebook) have a structure where feeds are public to all followers, which limits personalized communication. It is difficult for users to selectively restrict the content they want to share based on different relationships and situations, such as with family, friends, or coworkers. As a result, users often upload content that can be shared with everyone, rather than natural, personal moments. This structure makes it hard to authentically share personal emotions and experiences, which can ultimately lead to communication on social media becoming monotonous and formal.


    \subsection{Solution}
        \subsubsection{Voice-Based Daily Sharing}
        Voice input alone enables natural daily sharing. When speaking about daily experiences or thoughts, these vocal expressions automatically transform into text with relevant generated images, creating complete feeds. This direct voice-to-feed conversion eliminates manual text input or photo selection, making daily sharing effortless, especially during busy routines.

        \subsubsection{Cross-Generational Connection through Intuitive Interface and Automatic Generation}
        Automatic content creation and a user-friendly interface remove digital barriers with simple conversation, without the need for complicated processes. The system automatically converts spoken words into text and generates relevant content, making it easy for elderly family members who may not be familiar with digital technology to communicate. Children can also express themselves freely through natural speech, with content automatically generated to match their expressions. This approach bridges generational technology gaps and creates an inclusive environment where every family member can naturally participate in daily sharing.

        \subsubsection{Group Feed Service for Sharing with Selected Groups}
        Users can create desired groups (such as family, friends, coworkers, etc.) and share their feeds only with specific groups. This feature allows communication tailored to different relationships and situations. For example, users can share personal moments with family while sharing work-related updates with colleagues, ensuring that content is appropriate for each group. This group feed service enhances the user experience by enabling more personal and natural communication, helping to maintain more meaningful relationships on social media.

    \subsection{Research on Any Relative Software}
        \subsubsection{OpenAI DALL-E 3}
        Transforms daily moments into natural visual expressions. Creates high-quality images within two seconds based on voice or text input, adjusting styles to reflect conversational context and emotions. Generates safe, family-friendly images that richly express family moments and feelings while maintaining creative authenticity.

    \section{Specification}
   \subsection{Loading Page}
        \begin{figure}[htbp]
            \centerline{\includegraphics[width=3cm]{Images/page/loading.png}}
            \caption{Loading Page}
            \label{fig}
        \end{figure}
        % When an application communicates with servers, a delay is inevitable in the process. During the delay, it might show just a blank screen to users. To prevent users from getting a blank page, a loading screen will appear instead. This applies to all functions that require server communication.

        % This loading page UI is made by 'skeleton' from React Native. While receiving data from the server, components without received data shows that it is loading. In other words, while server is processing and receiving data after a http request has been made by the client. It can make a seamless and user friendly UI by using the loading screen. 
        The loading page ensures a seamless experience during server communication delays by displaying a heart-themed Lottie animation (heartbeat.json) in a continuous loop and a dynamic loading message, "Connecting your hearts. Please wait for a moment!" The text scales smoothly using React Native's Animated API, providing a lively effect. The background is a calming beige, and the design uses the custom font 'Pretendard' for a clean and modern look, ensuring users stay engaged during the wait.
        
   \subsection{Login Page}
        \begin{figure}[htbp]
            \centerline{\includegraphics[width=3cm]{Images/page/login.png}}
            \caption{Login Page}
            \label{fig}
        \end{figure}
        The login page serves as the initial entry point of the application. Without logging in, users cannot access any of the app's features. Users can log in with an existing account or create a new one if they do not already have an account.
        
        Back-End Perspective: 
        When a user submits their email and password, the client sends this data to the server's login API endpoint. The server validates the credentials against the stored user data in MongoDB. If valid, the server generates a JWT token using the user's ID and secret key. This token is returned to the client for authentication purposes and has an expiration time for security. Session management is handled by the server, and any active tokens are stored securely. The server also supports token-based authentication for secure API interactions. 
        
        Front-End Perspective:
        The login form is built using React Native. When the user taps on the email or password input fields, the field borders are highlighted with the app's brand color, and the keyboard appears. To maintain visibility, the screen adjusts automatically when the keyboard is active. Input validation ensures both fields contain valid data before enabling the login button. Upon pressing the login button, the app sends the credentials to the server and displays a loading state during authentication. Successful login navigates the user to the main feed of the application, while a failed login triggers an error message. The login button is disabled while the app processes the request to prevent duplicate submissions.

   \subsection{Register Page}
        \begin{figure}[htbp]
            \centerline{\includegraphics[width=3cm]{Images/page/register.jpg}}
            \caption{Register Page}
            \label{fig}
        \end{figure}
        The registration page allows users to create a new account by providing their email, nickname, password, and password confirmation. Users must ensure all fields are filled correctly, and the password matches the confirmation field. The password must also meet the minimum requirement of at least six characters. 
        Once the user submits the registration form, the data is sent to the server for processing. The server validates the email's uniqueness and ensures the nickname is not already in use. If all validations pass, the user data is securely stored, and the user is redirected to the login page. 
        The registration form is designed with React Native, featuring a clean and user-friendly interface. The registration button remains inactive until all fields are properly filled. During the registration process, a loading state is displayed to indicate progress. If the registration fails, an alert message informs the user of the issue, allowing them to make corrections and try again. 
        The page is styled consistently with the app's branding, maintaining a seamless user experience from registration to login.

   \subsection{MainFeed Page}
        \begin{figure}[htbp]
            \centerline{\includegraphics[width=3cm]{Images/page/feed.png}}
            \caption{MainFeed Page}
            \label{fig}
        \end{figure}
        The dashboard page is the main feed page (main page) that is first shown to users after login succeeds. The main function of the dashboard page is showing all of the friends' real-time latest posts. To help this objective, users can infinitely scroll down the page. Also the user can delete or revise the post through the delete/revise button on the top-right side of the post.

        These two buttons are basically invisible, but only the post owner can see them. And the emotion emojis below the post content are the emotions for the users can select his/her own daily mood. The only selected emotion is shown as opacity 100\% and the others are as transparency 50\%. These data can be sourced from the MongoDB database and the AWS S3 cloud then shown to the users.

        At the bottom of the screen, there is a menu bar that can lead user to another screen and functions. For the main menu bar, there are AI-CLOI, AI-album, main feed, friend list, and my page. At the top of the screen, if the user presses the middle '—' button, the screen is transited to the group selection screen.

        It's a screen composed of tabs, and from the user's perspective, it's not ideal to send requests every time you switch tabs, as it can cause delays. Therefore, as soon as user enters this screen, all the data is fetched all at once. This data is stored in a context for later use.

    \subsection{Friend Page}
        \begin{figure}[htbp]
            \centerline{
            \includegraphics[width=3cm]{Images/page/friends.png}
            \includegraphics[width=3cm]{Images/page/addFriend.jpg}}
            \caption{Friend Page}
            \label{fig}
        \end{figure}
        To share the posts with other users, a user should add other users as 'friend'. The friend means they can make a group and can see their posts each other. If a user presses the 'friend' tab in the main menu bar, the friend list screen is shown and the user can search for the users through the add (+) button in the right-bottom side of the screen.

        Users can search for other users by his/her nickname. Then after user1 adds user2 as friend, the friend request message is sent to the user2. User2 can see this message through the notification function. If the user2 accepts, they be 'friend' from that time. In the friend list, if the user presses the trash can icon button, the user can delete the selected user from friend list.

     \subsection{Group Page}
        \begin{figure}[htbp]
            \centerline{
            \includegraphics[width=3cm]{Images/page/group.png}
            \includegraphics[width=3cm]{Images/page/addGroup.jpg}}
             \caption{Group Page}
            \label{fig}
        \end{figure}
        In the group list screen, if user can presses group for a long time, the user can change group name, and if he/she just tab once, the group member list is shown. If the user want to delete a member, then he/she can do this through trash can icon. 

        If a user presses the '—' button at the top of the main feed page, all of the group list page is shown to users. If the user presses the trash icon button in the friend list, the selected user is deleted from the friend list. The add (+) button in the right-bottom side is group creation button. If a user presses it, the group name input pop up is shown and the user can make a new group. The group name must be up to 6 Korean letters and the "Group name must be up to 6 letters." error message is shown in pop up if the size is over 6 letters. Successfully making group name, the screen is transited to friend list screen, and the user can add friends to the group or change group to another.

    \subsection{Feed Upload Page - AI Voice Recognition}
        \begin{figure}[htbp]
            \centerline{
            \includegraphics[width=3cm]{Images/page/recording1.jpg}
            \includegraphics[width=3cm]{Images/page/recording.png}}
              \caption{Feed Upload Page - AI Voice Recognition}
            \label{fig}
        \end{figure}
        In the feed upload process of the application, users are presented with voice recognition functionality powered by OpenAI API for converting spoken words into text. When accessing the feed upload screen, users can tap the microphone button to activate the voice recognition interface, which displays a visual audio waveform animation during recording.

        The recorded voice is processed through the OpenAI API for real-time speech-to-text conversion. The interface also provides an alternative option where users can bypass the voice recognition feature and directly input text using the keyboard, offering flexibility in content creation. The text input field features a clean, minimalist design that follows the application's visual style guide created in Figma.

        When users finish speaking, the text appears on the screen. The text can be edited or modified before proceeding to the next step of adding visual content to their post.

 \subsection{Feed Upload Page - AI Image Creation}
        \begin{figure}[htbp]
            \centerline{
            \includegraphics[width=3cm]{Images/page/creating.png}
            \includegraphics[width=3cm]{Images/page/writing.png}}
              \caption{Feed Upload Page - AI Image Creation}
            \label{fig}
        \end{figure}
        After obtaining the text content, either through voice recognition or manual input, the feed creation process moves to the visual content stage. Here, users are presented with two options: AI image generation or manual image selection from their gallery.

        When users choose AI image generation, the application processes the input text through an AI image generation model to create a visual representation of the text content. The generated image appears on the screen, displayed in a format optimized for the social media feed. If users are not satisfied with the initially generated image, they can tap the regenerate button to create a different variation based on the same text input.

        Alternatively, users have the option to select images directly from their device's gallery instead of using the AI-generated images. The gallery selection interface allows users to choose multiple images from their local storage. Whether using AI-generated images or manually selected ones, all visual content is stored in Amazon S3 cloud storage, while the post metadata and references are managed in MongoDB through the Express.js backend running on Amazon EC2. The entire upload process is managed through React Native's state management using Zustand, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience throughout the content creation flow.

  \subsection{CLOi Page}
        \begin{figure}[htbp]
            \centerline{\includegraphics[width=3cm]{Images/page/cloi1.png}
            \includegraphics[width=3cm]{Images/page/cloi4.png}
            }
            \caption{CLOi Page}
            \label{fig}
        \end{figure}
        The application features an AI companion called CLOI, which grows and evolves based on user engagement and activity within the platform. CLOI starts as a baby (LV.1) and progressively grows through stages - infant (LV.2), child (LV.3), teenager (LV.4), and adult (LV.5) - as users create and share more content on the platform.

        Each evolution level of CLOI is visually represented by different facial expressions and characteristics that reflect its growth stage, creating an emotional connection with users. The evolution system is managed through the Express.js backend, which tracks the number of posts created by the user and stores the progress in MongoDB. When users reach certain posting milestones, CLOI automatically evolves to its next stage.
        
        % When users reach certain posting milestones, CLOI automatically evolves to its next stage, with the transition animated to celebrate the growth moment. CLOI also functions as an interactive AI companion that generates personalized greetings and friendly messages for users. Using the OpenAI API, CLOI analyzes the user's activity patterns, posting frequency, and time of day to create contextually appropriate and engaging messages.

        % For example, CLOI might say "I see you're working hard on creating content today!" or "It's been a while since your last post, would you like to share something new?" These interactions are designed to encourage user engagement while maintaining a friendly, supportive presence. The message generation system considers CLOI's current evolution level, ensuring that the tone and complexity of interactions match its growth stage, making the experience more authentic and emotionally resonant. The entire CLOI system is integrated into the React Native frontend using Zustand for state management, ensuring smooth animations and transitions between different states and messages.

        

\subsection{Chatbot Page}
        \begin{figure}[htbp]
            \centerline{\includegraphics[width=3cm]{Images/page/chatbot.png}}

              \caption{Notification Page}
            \label{fig}
        \end{figure}
        The notification system keeps users updated on activities related to their content and connections in real-time, implemented with a custom backend and MongoDB. Users can view notifications in reverse chronological order, showing details like the triggering user's profile, action performed, and timestamps. Unread notifications are visually distinct.
        Friend requests allow direct responses to accept or reject. Accepted requests let users assign friends to groups, while rejected ones remove notifications. Users can also delete individual notifications to maintain a clean interface. Notifications are generated automatically based on activities like posts, comments, or friend requests, and are stored in MongoDB with metadata for efficient management. 
        The frontend, built with React Native and Zustand, ensures seamless navigation and visual clarity. Feedback for actions, such as accepting requests, is provided through Toast notifications. An Express.js backend on Amazon EC2 handles all notification-related processes, from creation to updates and deletions, enabling a responsive, user-friendly experience that keeps users informed and engaged.

  \subsection{MyPage}
        \begin{figure}[htbp]
            \centerline{\includegraphics[width=3cm]{Images/page/mypage.png}}
            \caption{MyPage}
            \label{fig}
        \end{figure}
        The My Page serves as a personal archive space where users can manage their profile and access their content history. At the top of the page, users can view and edit their profile information, including their nickname which can be modified by tapping on it.

        The page displays key statistics about the user's activity, including the total number of posts created and their current CLOI companion level. A "10-day posting streak" badge with a fire emoji indicates active user engagement, encouraging consistent platform participation.

        The page features two main archival sections: "My Posts" and "My Album". The My Posts section provides access to a chronological feed of all text-based and AI-generated content the user has shared on the platform. The My Album section serves as a dedicated photo gallery, organizing all images the user has uploaded through their posts, whether they were AI-generated or manually uploaded from their device.

        All content data is stored in Amazon S3 with references maintained in MongoDB, while the frontend interface is built using React Native with Zustand managing the state for smooth navigation and content loading. The layout follows the application's consistent design language, providing an intuitive and organized way for users to revisit and manage their content history.

\section{Architecture Design}
    \subsection{Overall Architecture}
        Our service consists of four modules: front-end, back-end, database and AI\\
            \begin{figure}[htbp]
                \centerline{\includegraphics[width = 9cm, height = 5cm]{Images/struct/hlarchi.png}}
                \label{fig}
                \caption{Overall Architecture}
            \end{figure}
            
                The first module is the frontend that directly interacts with the user. The frontend is developed using React Native and Expo CLI, enabling users to access backend services through the app. The app manages AI inputs (voice/text) and other SNS inputs while displaying results through HTTP communication with the backend server.
                
                The system utilizes a custom Speech-to-Text model fine-tuned on the Zeroth-Korean dataset for voice processing. The system integrates with DALL-E for image generation capabilities and ChatGPT 3.5 accessed through FastAPI for intelligent responses. The architecture supports realtime preview features through efficient client-server communication.
                
                The server-side infrastructure employs Node.js with Express on Amazon EC2, utilizing MongoDB Atlas for data storage and Amazon S3 for file management. For state management, React Hooks handle local state while Context API manages global state sharing across screens, ensuring consistent data flow throughout the application.
            
            \begin{figure}[htbp]
                \centerline{\includegraphics[width = 7cm, height = 10cm]{Images/struct/db.png}}
                \label{fig}
                \caption{Database Diagram}
            \end{figure}
            The second module is the backend system of HeartLink, which consists of a Node.js Express server, MongoDB database, and AWS S3 cloud storage. The main server manages core functionalities including user authentication, social networking features, and AI-powered interactions. All user-generated data is stored in MongoDB through the main server, which provides a robust foundation for real-time social interactions.
            
            The AI functionality is divided into three main areas and communicates with the server as follows:
            
            1. Voice Recognition: The server processes voice input using a custom STT (Speech-to-Text) model during feed creation. This model, trained on specialized datasets, converts spoken words into text in real-time. The processed text is temporarily stored in memory and directly forwarded to the FastAPI server for speech-to-text conversion. This text is then used for feed content and additional AI image generation processing.
                
            2. Image Generation: When a user requests AI image generation, the server communicates with OpenAI's DALL-E API. Text content, either manually entered or converted from voice, is sent to the DALL-E API along with specific image generation parameters. When the DALL-E API returns an image URL, the server downloads the image, converts it to a buffer, and uploads it to AWS S3 using the AWS SDK (S3Client). The server returns both the original DALL-E URL and the permanent S3 URL, which are stored in MongoDB along with the feed data.
            3. Virtual Character (Cloi): The system's AI companion Cloi interaction connects to a separate FastAPI Python server instead of directly connecting to the ChatGPT API. When users interact with Cloi, the Express server forwards requests to the FastAPI server, supporting both streaming and non-streaming responses through Server-Sent Events (SSE). The server maintains persistent connections using appropriate headers for streaming responses and includes health checks to monitor FastAPI server availability. Error handling is implemented for communication and processing failures. API responses are processed to maintain character consistency and personality according to Cloi's evolution stages (1-5).
            
            All backend components are deployed on AWS cloud infrastructure. The Node.js Express server runs on an EC2 instance (t2.micro) in the Seoul region, with proper security configurations for HTTP, HTTPS, and custom port access. The application uses PM2 for process management and Nginx as a reverse proxy, ensuring stable performance and secure communication.
            
            The system's media handling is streamlined through AWS S3 integration, using multer-s3 for efficient upload processing. Both user-uploaded and AI-generated images are stored in S3 buckets, while their references and metadata are maintained in MongoDB. This separation ensures optimal performance and scalability while maintaining data integrity.

            The HeartLink app provides social networking service (SNS) features that allow users to communicate and share everyday moments and memories through group feeds and group albums. Generative AI capabilities support users by enabling effortless post creation through voice recognition and text-based image generation. The front-end was developed using React Native, supporting cross-platform development and leveraging Expo to check actual app screens during development. It facilitates user-server interactions, allowing user-entered values to be stored in the backend and displaying data provided by the backend for users.\\

        \subsubsection{Functionality}
            The HeartLink app's frontend enables users to log in and sign up, providing seamless access to the app while allowing easy management of user profiles and account settings. It also offers a user-friendly interface for creating posts in group feeds, utilizing AI voice recognition to input text or AI image generation to effortlessly add images. Users can view multiple group posts simultaneously through the all-group feed or visually organized content using the group album feature, which collects and displays shared images by specific groups. Through intuitive interfaces for adding friends and managing groups, users can foster communication and collaboration within groups. Additionally, the interactive UI for engaging with the virtual companion, Cloi, gamifies SNS activities, enhancing user participation and increasing the fun of the app experience.\\

    \subsection{Module 2: Back-End}
        \subsubsection{Purpose} 
            The backend of the HeartLink app serves as the core component that processes user requests and interacts with the database to generate appropriate responses. It receives data in JSON format from the frontend and performs Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, returning the results in JSON format to the frontend and the app.
            Additionally, the backend supports essential features like group feeds, notifications, friend requests, and the growth management of the virtual character Cloi. It also handles functionalities such as file uploads, AI-based image generation, and S3 storage management.\\
            \vspace{3mm}
        \subsubsection{Functionality}
            The HeartLink app's backend processes user requests by performing CRUD operations on the database and returning the results in JSON format. It validates user authentication status using JWT token-based middleware, ensuring that only authenticated users can access specific routes. The backend manages Cloi’s state, including its level, growth, and name, and updates its development based on user activities such as posts and comments. It also enables interaction with Cloi through conversations.
            Using AWS S3 and Multer, the backend facilitates image uploads and manages the uploaded files, associating them with user feeds or group albums. It provides features for creating, modifying, and deleting user feeds, filtering feeds by friends or groups, and managing group creation, modification, deletion, and member activities. It handles friend addition, removal, and requests, as well as notifying users of friend request updates.
            Furthermore, the backend supports generating and managing notifications for user activities, such as comments, friend requests, and more. It offers features to upload, delete, and manage group album photos and provides functions to view and organize personal content, such as nicknames and profile images.\\

    \subsection{Module 3: Database}
        \subsubsection{Purpose}
            The database of the HeartLink app serves as the backbone for storing and managing all critical data related to users, feeds, comments, groups, notifications, and the virtual character Cloi. By storing this data in a structured and relational manner, the database ensures seamless functionality, efficient data retrieval, and an enhanced user experience. It supports all core functionalities of the app, including user interactions, group management, and AI-powered features.\\
            \vspace{3mm}
        \subsubsection{Functionality}
            The HeartLink database interacts with the backend server to handle all CRUD operations. When users create new data, the server leverages MongoDB Atlas to insert new entries into the database. Data retrieval is optimized through queries that utilize indexes, ensuring fast and accurate responses. User activities such as creating posts or sending friend requests trigger updates to relevant records, including notifications and Cloi's growth statistics. Additionally, when users delete content or update their profiles, the database reflects these changes in real time across the app, maintaining consistency and responsiveness.\\
            \vspace{3mm}

                \item Feed Collection\\
                The Feed collection manages posts created by users. Each feed is uniquely identified by a feedId and is associated with the user via the userId field. Additional fields include content, groupId (categorizing posts by group), and images (both user-uploaded and AI-generated). The Feed collection supports creating, updating, and deleting posts while integrating with comments and group functionalities for enhanced engagement.
                \vspace{3mm}                
                \item Comment Collection\\
                The Comment collection handles user-generated comments on posts. Each comment is uniquely identified by a commentId and is linked to a feed and a user through their respective IDs. Fields include content, creation date, and status (e.g., active or deleted). This collection facilitates user interaction and conversations within the app.
                \vspace{3mm}                
                \item Cloi Collection\\
                The Cloi collection stores data for the virtual character Cloi, linked to users via the userId field. Fields include the character's name (customizable by users), level (indicating growth), feedCount, and commentCount. Cloi's state dynamically updates based on user activities like posting feeds or commenting, enhancing the app's gamified experience.
                \vspace{3mm}                
                \item FriendList Collection\\
                The FriendList collection records friendships between users. It includes userId and friendId fields to represent the relationship between two users. An optional group field allows users to categorize their friends for better organization. The collection supports adding, removing, and managing friends within the app.
                \vspace{3mm}                
                \item FriendRequest Collection\\
                The FriendRequest collection tracks pending friend requests between users. It includes fields like fromId (requester) and toId (recipient) and a status field to denote the request's state (e.g., pending, accepted, declined). This collection integrates with the notification system to support workflows for adding friends.
                \vspace{3mm}                
                \item Group Collection\\
                The Group collection manages user-created groups with fields such as groupId, gName (group name), createdBy (group creator), and members. This collection allows users to create, edit, delete groups, and manage group-specific interactions, facilitating organized communication and sharing.
                \vspace{3mm}     
                \item Notification Collection\\
                The Notification collection stores notifications related to user activities, including friend requests, comments, and Cloi level-ups. Notifications can be marked as read and keep users informed about app events.It contains fields such as userId (recipient), triggeredBy (initiator), message, and type (e.g., friend_request, comment).
                \vspace{3mm} 
  
            \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Module 4: AI}
        \subsubsection{Purpose}
            The AI module of HeartLink integrates various AI technologies to enhance user experiences. It combines text-based conversations (ChatGPT), image generation (DALL-E), and Auto Speech Recognition (ASR) to provide rich interactive experiences. These AI services run on a FastAPI-based backend server, processing user requests in real-time. The HuggingFace Transformer's whisper model, fine-tuned for optimal Korean speech recognition, effectively converts voice input to text. Text-based conversations and image generation utilize OpenAI APIs to ensure reliable AI services.\\
            \vspace{3mm}
        \subsubsection{Functionality}
            The HeartLink app's AI module provides automatic feed generation through speech recognition and natural conversations with characters. The speech recognition model was fine-tuned from OpenAI's Whisper model using Korean speech datasets for optimal Korean language processing, enabling real-time voice-to-text conversion. The DALL-E image generation system utilizes DALL-E 3 to create high-quality 1024x1024 pixel images from text prompts, with options for URL-based access or local storage. The ChatGPT-based conversation system leverages GPT-3.5-turbo for natural language processing, supporting both streaming and standard response modes while maintaining context across messages for seamless dialogue flow.\\
