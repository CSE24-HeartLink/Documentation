\section{Introduction}
    \subsection{Motivation}
    Just Speak, and Stay Connected

    Communication remains essential to all relationships. However, as our lives grow increasingly busy, maintaining natural and effortless connections becomes ever more challenging. While we commonly share our daily lives through texts and photos, these methods can sometimes lose their authenticity. Now, there is a need for a new mode of connectionâ€”one that allows us to capture and share moments through voice.

    With advancements in voice recognition and AI technology, this vision has become achievable. Particularly in family communication, a system that records daily moments through voice and automatically generates a feed for sharing can profoundly enhance connections. By converting voice-recorded moments into text and images, and automatically delivering these to family members, this system allows for more seamless and genuine communication between parents and children, as well as across generations.

    For instance, parents can stay updated on their children's daily lives without needing direct contact, while children can remain connected with family members through shared voice and visual updates. This voice-based interface not only bridges the digital divide between generations but also fosters a more natural and continuous flow of family communication.

    \subsection{Problem Statements}
        \subsubsection{Difficulty in Naturally Sharing Daily Life}
        Current social media platforms primarily rely on text input and photo uploads, making it challenging for users to capture and share their daily lives naturally. In situations where hands are occupied or real-time sharing is desired, users often have to interrupt or modify their experiences to create content that fits platform requirements. This compromises the authenticity of moments shared and makes it difficult to convey emotional depth in these interactions.
        
        \subsubsection{Generational Gaps in Digital Accessibility}
        Existing social media interfaces do not adequately address the accessibility differences that arise from variations in age and digital proficiency, which poses limitations for intergenerational family communication. Elderly users often find complex text input methods and intricate menu structures challenging, while younger children may struggle to express themselves naturally within traditional interfaces. These generational gaps hinder regular family communication, creating the risk that the perspectives and experiences of certain family members may be excluded from the family's shared narrative.
        
        \subsubsection{Platform Limitations in Sustaining Family Connections}
        The structure of current platforms often hampers the long-term maintenance of family connections. The manual effort required for content creation and non-intuitive interfaces discourage ongoing engagement, particularly in family settings. For instance, children may find it burdensome to consistently share updates with parents, and parents may gradually lose touch with their children's daily lives. Furthermore, the lack of features for accumulating daily moments and emotions over time means that, as the years go by, these platforms fall short in supporting the depth and emotional bonds essential to lasting family relationships.

    \subsection{Solution}
        \subsubsection{Voice-Based Daily Sharing}
        Voice input alone enables natural daily sharing among family members. When speaking about daily experiences or thoughts, these vocal expressions automatically transform into text with relevant generated images, creating complete feeds. This direct voice-to-feed conversion eliminates manual text input or photo selection, making daily sharing effortless, especially during busy routines.

        \subsubsection{Family Connection Beyond Space and Time}
        Continuous family bonding transcends physical distance and lifestyle differences. Family members access shared moments at their convenience, removing time constraints from daily communication. Different time zones or busy schedules no longer hinder connection - each family member's daily life remains naturally shared and understood, maintaining meaningful relationships despite physical separation.

        \subsubsection{Cross-Generational Connection}
        Natural voice interaction eliminates digital barriers through simple conversation, without complex menus or text input. Elderly members unfamiliar with digital technology communicate easily through voice, while children express themselves freely through natural speech. This approach dissolves generational technology gaps, creating an inclusive environment where every family member participates naturally in daily sharing.

    \subsection{Research on Any Relative Software}
        \subsubsection{CLOVA Voice Recognition}
        Deep learning capabilities enable accurate voice capture even in multi-speaker environments. Real-time noise filtering captures natural home conversations while emotion analysis and context understanding detect subtle family nuances.

                \item Text-Based Image Generation: Based on the text written by the user or text created by AI based on users' voice input, AI generates an image. This allows users to include appropriate images in their posts without directly uploading photos, by generating images that match the written content.
            \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{Post Archive}
            By tapping the 'Archive' button in the bottom navigation bar, users can access a personal archive where only their own posts are stored. Here, users can easily manage their posts, adjusting visibility settings (public/private), as well as editing or deleting specific posts.

        \subsubsection{Family/Friends Shared Photo Album}
            Users can create albums (folders) and select specific photos from their feed to include in these albums. By organizing photos into albums, users can manage which photos are displayed, and they can designate access permissions for each album, allowing only family members or close friends to view them.

            \begin{itemize}
                \item AI Collage Creation: Based on the photos in the shared photo album, AI can generate a "memory collage." This collage visually captures memories and gives a decorative effect. With a simple "Create" button, users can generate this collage, and the resulting collage can be downloaded for individual storage.
            \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{Adding Friends}
            Although this SNS primarily focuses on family interaction, users can also add friends to share photos with them. This feature is designed for users who want to communicate with friends as well as family members.

        \subsubsection{Raising Our Family's Pet CLOi}
            To motivate family participation in the SNS, we introduced a feature to raise a virtual pet called "CLOi."

\section{Requirement Specifications}
    \subsection{Loading Page}
        When an application communicates with servers, a delay is inevitable in the process. During the delay, it might show just a blank screen to users. To prevent users from getting a blank page, a loading screen will appear instead. This applies to all functions that require server communication.

        This loading page UI is made by 'skeleton' from React Native. While receiving data from the server, components without received data shows that it is loading. In other words, while server is processing and receiving data after a http request has been made by the client. It can make a seamless and user friendly UI by using the loading screen. 
        
\subsection{Log-in Page}
        The login page serves as the initial entry point of the application. Without a login, it is impossible to use any of the functions of the app. If the application is not logged in, users can create their own account or login using an account they have created before.

        In a back-end point of view, The client collects the user's phone number and password and sends a request to Firebase Authentication when the login button is pressed. Firebase handles the authentication process and returns a JWT token. The token has an expiration time for security purposes and needs to be refreshed periodically. After Firebase authentication succeeds, the application server (running on Amazon EC2) receives the user information and handles the session management. Express.js backend stores essential user data in MongoDB and manages user sessions.

        In a front-end point of view, when a user taps on either the phone number or password input field in the React Native application, the field's border becomes highlighted with the application's brand color, and the mobile keyboard appears. The screen automatically adjusts upward when the keyboard appears to ensure input fields remain visible. If the user enters their phone number and presses the next button on the keyboard, the focus automatically moves to the password field. The password is masked with dots while being entered for security. Both phone number and password fields must contain valid input for the login button to become active. When the login button is pressed, it enters a loading state while the authentication process occurs. After successful login, the user is directed to the main feed view of the social networking application. If the login fails, an alert message appears explaining the error, and the user remains on the login screen to try again.

    \subsection{Register Page}
        For the registration process, users must provide their phone number which serves as their unique identifier in the system. The registration flow begins with phone number verification through Firebase Authentication. Users enter their phone number and receive a verification code via SMS. Once verified, they proceed to fill in additional required information including name, nickname (displayed to other users in the SNS platform), password, and password confirmation.

        On the client side, built with React Native and managed with Zustand for state management, there are immediate validations for input format and matching password fields. The UI follows the application's design system created in Figma, maintaining consistency with the login screen's behavior. The registration button activates only when all fields are properly filled and validated.

        When submitted, the verified user data is first processed through Firebase Authentication, and upon success, the additional user information is sent to our Express.js backend running on EC2. The backend performs secondary validation before storing the user profile in MongoDB, with any user-uploaded profile images being stored in Amazon S3. If registration succeeds, users are redirected to the login page. In case of failure, appropriate error messages are displayed through the app's alert system, allowing users to correct their input and try again.

    \subsection{Dashboard (Main Feed Page)}
        The dashboard page is the main feed page (main page) that is first shown to users after login succeeds. The main function of the dashboard page is showing all of the friends' real-time latest posts. To help this objective, users can infinitely scroll down the page. Also the user can delete or revise the post through the delete/revise button on the top-right side of the post.

        These two buttons are basically invisible, but only the post owner can see them. And the emotion emojis below the post content are the emotions for the users can select his/her own daily mood. The only selected emotion is shown as opacity 100\% and the others are as transparency 50\%. These data can be sourced from the MongoDB database and the AWS S3 cloud then shown to the users.

        At the bottom of the screen, there is a menu bar that can lead user to another screen and functions. For the main menu bar, there are AI-CLOI, AI-album, main feed, friend list, and my page. At the top of the screen, if the user presses the middle 'â€”' button, the screen is transited to the group selection screen.

        It's a screen composed of tabs, and from the user's perspective, it's not ideal to send requests every time you switch tabs, as it can cause delays. Therefore, as soon as user enters this screen, all the data is fetched all at once. This data is stored in a context for later use.

    \subsection{Add-Friends Page}
        To share the posts with other users, a user should add other users as 'friend'. The friend means they can make a group and can see their posts each other. If a user presses the 'friend' tab in the main menu bar, the friend list screen is shown and the user can search for the users through the add (+) button in the right-bottom side of the screen.

        Users can search for other users by his/her nickname. Then after user1 adds user2 as friend, the friend request message is sent to the user2. User2 can see this message through the notification function. If the user2 accepts, they be 'friend' from that time. In the friend list, if the user presses the trash can icon button, the user can delete the selected user from friend list.

    \subsection{Add-Groups Page}
        In the group list screen, if user can presses group for a long time, the user can change group name, and if he/she just tab once, the group member list is shown. If the user want to delete a member, then he/she can do this through trash can icon. If the user want to delete the group, he/she should delete all of the members.

        If a user presses the 'â€”' button at the top of the main feed page, all of the group list page is shown to users. If the user presses the trash icon button in the friend list, the selected user is deleted from the friend list. The add (+) button in the right-bottom side is group creation button. If a user presses it, the group name input pop up is shown and the user can make a new group. The group name must be up to 6 Korean letters and the "Group name must be up to 6 letters." error message is shown in pop up if the size is over 6 letters. Successfully making group name, the screen is transited to friend list screen, and the user can add friends to the group or change group to another.

    \subsection{Album Page - AI-Collage}
        [-------------------------------------------------]

    \subsection{Feed Upload Page - AI Voice Recognition}
        In the feed upload process of the application, users are presented with voice recognition functionality powered by OpenAI API for converting spoken words into text. When accessing the feed upload screen, users can tap the microphone button to activate the voice recognition interface, which displays a visual audio waveform animation during recording.

        The recorded voice is processed through the OpenAI API for real-time speech-to-text conversion. The interface also provides an alternative option where users can bypass the voice recognition feature and directly input text using the keyboard, offering flexibility in content creation. The text input field features a clean, minimalist design that follows the application's visual style guide created in Figma.

        As users speak or type, the text appears in real-time, and they can edit or modify it before proceeding to the next step of adding visual content to their post.

    \subsection{Feed Upload Page - AI Image Creation}
        After obtaining the text content, either through voice recognition or manual input, the feed creation process moves to the visual content stage. Here, users are presented with two options: AI image generation or manual image selection from their gallery.

        When users choose AI image generation, the application processes the input text through an AI image generation model to create a visual representation of the text content. The generated image appears on the screen, displayed in a format optimized for the social media feed. If users are not satisfied with the initially generated image, they can tap the regenerate button to create a different variation based on the same text input.

        Alternatively, users have the option to select images directly from their device's gallery instead of using the AI-generated images. The gallery selection interface allows users to choose multiple images from their local storage. Whether using AI-generated images or manually selected ones, all visual content is stored in Amazon S3 cloud storage, while the post metadata and references are managed in MongoDB through the Express.js backend running on Amazon EC2. The entire upload process is managed through React Native's state management using Zustand, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience throughout the content creation flow.

    \subsection{AI-CLOI Page}
        The application features an AI companion called CLOI, which grows and evolves based on user engagement and activity within the platform. CLOI starts as a baby (LV.1) and progressively grows through stages - infant (LV.2), child (LV.3), teenager (LV.4), and adult (LV.5) - as users create and share more content on the platform.

        Each evolution level of CLOI is visually represented by different facial expressions and characteristics that reflect its growth stage, creating an emotional connection with users. The evolution system is managed through the Express.js backend, which tracks the number of posts created by the user and stores the progress in MongoDB.

        When users reach certain posting milestones, CLOI automatically evolves to its next stage, with the transition animated to celebrate the growth moment. CLOI also functions as an interactive AI companion that generates personalized greetings and friendly messages for users. Using the OpenAI API, CLOI analyzes the user's activity patterns, posting frequency, and time of day to create contextually appropriate and engaging messages.

        For example, CLOI might say "I see you're working hard on creating content today!" or "It's been a while since your last post, would you like to share something new?" These interactions are designed to encourage user engagement while maintaining a friendly, supportive presence. The message generation system considers CLOI's current evolution level, ensuring that the tone and complexity of interactions match its growth stage, making the experience more authentic and emotionally resonant. The entire CLOI system is integrated into the React Native frontend using Zustand for state management, ensuring smooth animations and transitions between different states and messages.

    \subsection{Notification Page}
        The notification system in the application keeps users informed about interactions with their content and friend activity through Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). When a new notification arrives, a red dot indicator appears on the notification bell icon in the top right corner of the main page, providing a visual cue for unread notifications.

        These notifications can be viewed in two ways: as push notifications delivered through FCM when the app is in the background, or as in-app alerts that slide down from the top of the screen for active users. The notification page displays a chronological history of all notifications, with each entry showing the interacting user's profile picture, the specific action taken, and relevant timestamps.

        For friend requests, users can respond directly through accept or decline buttons on the notification entry. The notification data is managed through the Express.js backend and stored in MongoDB, while the frontend uses React Native with Zustand for state management, ensuring smooth rendering and real-time updates of notification status.

    \subsection{My Page}
        The My Page serves as a personal archive space where users can manage their profile and access their content history. At the top of the page, users can view and edit their profile information, including their nickname which can be modified by tapping on it.

        The page displays key statistics about the user's activity, including the total number of posts created and their current CLOI companion level. A "10-day posting streak" badge with a fire emoji indicates active user engagement, encouraging consistent platform participation.

        The page features two main archival sections: "My Posts" and "My Album". The My Posts section provides access to a chronological feed of all text-based and AI-generated content the user has shared on the platform. The My Album section serves as a dedicated photo gallery, organizing all images the user has uploaded through their posts, whether they were AI-generated or manually uploaded from their device.

        All content data is stored in Amazon S3 with references maintained in MongoDB, while the frontend interface is built using React Native with Zustand managing the state for smooth navigation and content loading. The layout follows the application's consistent design language, providing an intuitive and organized way for users to revisit and manage their content history.
